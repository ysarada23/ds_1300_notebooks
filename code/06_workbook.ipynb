    "\n",
    "Dask Array does not implement the entire numpy interface.  Users expecting this\n",
    "will be disappointed.  Notably Dask Array has the following failings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Dask does not implement all of ``np.linalg``.  This has been done by a\n",
    "    number of excellent BLAS/LAPACK implementations and is the focus of\n",
    "    numerous ongoing academic research projects.\n",
    "2.  Dask Array does not support some operations where the resulting shape\n",
    "    depends on the values of the array. For those that it does support\n",
    "    (for example, masking one Dask Array with another boolean mask),\n",
    "    the chunk sizes will be unknown, which may cause issues with other\n",
    "    operations that need to know the chunk sizes.\n",
    "3.  Dask Array does not attempt operations like ``sort`` which are notoriously\n",
    "    difficult to do in parallel and are of somewhat diminished value on very\n",
    "    large data (you rarely actually need a full sort).\n",
    "    Often we include parallel-friendly alternatives like ``topk``.\n",
    "4.  Dask development is driven by immediate need, and so many lesser used\n",
    "    functions, like ``np.sometrue`` have not been implemented purely out of\n",
    "    laziness.  These would make excellent community contributions.\n",
