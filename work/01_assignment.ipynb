Because of this, we will import that code into this program simply by running the cell with the import that goes with that code.  Here is what you will see, only in commented code."

    "Now we might want to apply the names of each of the traditional \"books\" you might think of when you think about the Lord of the Rings. To do this we need to use a function that is very powerful and flexible: [apply](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html). This function will allow us to apply an operation or function to each value in a column and save it into a new column. In this example, our \"function\" is using our *CollectionNum* to reference a book name in our list *titles*."
